# Python_plays_GTA_SA
This is a fun project with python to explore the uses of machine learning in GTA San Andreas.
There are several steps involve for this to work.
1. We need to a write python programs that can take the input from the screen and process that data to further use.
2. We can use Re inforcement Learning or any other logical algorithm that can train our model.
3. Make sure that your pc and python is able to give 'keyboard_press' as output to the game.
